Project - Getting and Cleaning Data

The project.R script does the data preparation and then the 5 steps required in the course project.
Downloading the dataset</b>

Dataset is downloaded through "https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip" and extracted under UCI HAR Dataset using unzip() function.
Assigning each data to variables

features <- features.txt
This has 561 rows and 2 columns. The features selected for this database is from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ respectively.

activities <- activities.txt
This has 6 rows and 2 columns.
List of activities performed when the corresponding measurements were taken and its codes (labels)

subject_test <- test/subject_test.txt
This contains 2947 rows and 1 column
This contains the test data of 9/30 volunteer test subjects

x_test <- test/X_test.txt
It contains 2947 rows and 561 columns
This contains recorded features of test data

y_test <- test/y_test.txt
It has 2947 rows and 1 column
This contains test data of activities index labels

subject_train <- test/subject_train.txt
This has 7352 rows and 1 column
It contains train data of 21/30 volunteer for train subjects

x_train <- test/X_train.txt
This has 7352 rows and 561 columns
It contains recorded features of train data

y_train <- test/y_train.txt
This has 7352 rows and 1 column
This contains train data of activities index labels

Required Steps

1.Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.

X
This contains 10299 rows and 561 columns
Created by merging the x_train and x_test using rbind() function

Y
This has 10299 rows and 1 column
Created by merging y_train and y_test using rbind() function

subject
This has 10299 rows and 1 column
This is created by merging subject_train and subject_test using rbind() function

Merged_data
This contains 10299 rows and 563 columns
Created by merging subject, Y and X using cbind() function

2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.

tidyData
This has 10299 rows and 88 columns
It is created by subsetting Merged_data and selecting only the columns: subject, index and the measurements over the mean and standard deviation (std) for each measurement
Then exporting tidyData to tidyData.txt file

3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
Entire numbers in index column of the tidyData is replaced with corresponding activity taken from second column of the activities variable

4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
'index' column in the 'tidyData' is renamed into 'activities'
'Acc' is replaced by 'Accelerometer'
'Gyro' is replaced by 'Gyroscope'
'BodyBody' is replaced by 'Body'
'Mag' is replaced by 'Magnitude'
characters that start with 'f' is replaced by 'Frequency'
character that start with 't' is replaced by 'Time'

5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

newData
This has 180 rows and 88 columns
It is created by sumarizing tidyData, taking the means of each variable for each activity and each subject, after grouping by subject and activity.
Then exporting newData to newData.txt file
